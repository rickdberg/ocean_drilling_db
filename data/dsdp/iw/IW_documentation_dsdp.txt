 I.  INTRODUCTION


 A.  BACKGROUND AND METHODS

     Interstitial water was extracted aboard the R/V Glomar
     Challenger from sediment samples that were evenly spaced down
     the hole.  The expressed fluids were normally divided into
     several aliquots, one of which was used immediately for
     shipboard determination of any or all of the following:  pH,
     alkalinity, salinity, chlorinity, calcium, magnesium and
     rarely, ammonia, phosphate and silica.  Remaining aliquots were
     packaged and shipped to participating investigators ashore.
     Please refer to the individual contributions from these
     investigators printed in the Initial Reports (see field=
     REFERENCE) and to the article listed in the bibliography below
     for detailed information about techniques of pore fluid
     extraction and analysis.

     The information recorded in this database represents the
     overwhelming majority of pore water chemistry data published
     in the Initial Reports.  However, certain types of results
     (e.g.  isotope data) were not encoded, therefore reference
     to the Initial Reports is essential when utilizing these
     data.  When no data or limited data from a site was
     published in the Initial Report then data was entered into
     the database directly from the lab notebook compiled aboard
     the vessel.  Microfilm of most of these notebooks is
     available from the National Geophysical Data Center in
     Boulder, Colorado.

 B. FIELD DESCRIPTIONS

    The definition of leg, site, hole, core and section may be
    found in the explanatory notes.  In addition, the special
    core designations, as well as the methods of sample labeling
    and  calculating  absolute  sample  depths  are discussed.



   TOP OF SAMPLED INTERVAL and BOTTOM OF SAMPLED INTERVAL:

     The depth, in centimeters, within a section to the top or
     bottom of the sediment sample.  Values are encoded with an
     implicit decimal point.  An encoded value of 805 represents
     80.5 centimeters.


   DEPTH TO CORE:       (see formulae at end of this document)

     The subbottom depth in meters to the top of the core.


   DEPTH TO SAMPLE:      (see formulae at end of this document)

     The subbottom depth in meters to the center of the sampled
     interval.


   CARD IDENTIFIER:

           CARD TYPE:
                "A" = data card    "C" = comment card

           CARD NUMBER:

                 A logical data record consists of all of the "A"
                 cards with the identical DSDP label (cols 1-19).
                 The field identifiers are CARD NUMBER specific,
                 as shown under DATA FIELD below.

     Not every card is present within one logical record and
     duplicate card numbers  exist, however these records are
     unique in that they  have different REFERENCEs, indicating
     different sources.  If the CARD NUMBER is greater than 4 then
     it will contain only additional pH and/or alkalinity values.


   pH ELECTRODE TYPE:

    "R" = combination      "P" = punch-in      "F" = flow-thru
     See Gieskes, 1973 for further explanation.


   pH:

     Measured value of pH in units of pH.


  ALKALINITY MEASUREMENT TYPE:

     "C" = colorimetric "P" = potentiometric
      See Gieskes, 1973 for further explanation.


   ALKALINITY:

     Calculated value of alkalinity.


   SALINITY:

     Salinity as measured with a hand-held Goldberg refractometer.

     CARD NUMBER-specific data fields.

Additional Notes:  Many cores in this file are "ssw" cores, which are
in-situ measurements as described in this file.  These "ssw" cores are
not searchable using the CD-ROM select software as individual cores,
but may be copied or browsed by selecting the entire hole in which they
occur.
